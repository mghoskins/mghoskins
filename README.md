### Hello, 
My name is Matthew G. Hoskins.  I am a Software Engineering Student at Iowa State University in my third year.
I'm currently looking for an internship for this summer.
I'm also trying to build up my non-school (personal) GitHub account (this one) to show what I can do to perspective employers.  
Also to keep my work that I do whether it be code, school work, or something that I want to have a backup of.
